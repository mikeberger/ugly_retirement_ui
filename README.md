# Ugly Retirement UI
An almost adequate retirement calculator

Just open the html file in a browser.
I am not a web developer or a JS developer, so it is ugly, but simple.

I recommend the Flexible Retirement Planner - https://www.flexibleretirementplanner.com/ for possibly the most in depth retirement planning you can do and as a place to start.

If you evenutally come to the conclusion that Retirement Age, Spending, and Inflation are the only things that seem to matter, my planner might be much quicker and easier.
