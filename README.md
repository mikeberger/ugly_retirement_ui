# Ugly Retirement UI
An almost adequate retirement calculator

I am not a web developer or a JS developer, so it is ugly, but simple.

I recommend the Flexible Retirement Planner - https://www.flexibleretirementplanner.com/ for in depth retirement planning as a place to start. 

If you evenutally come to the conclusion that Retirement Age, Spending, and Inflation are the only things that seem to matter, my planner might be quicker and easier.
