# Ugly Retirement UI
An almost adequate retirement calculator

https://mbcsoft.com/ret.html

I am not a web developer or a JS developer, so it is ugly, but simple.

I recommend the Flexible Retirement Planner - https://www.flexibleretirementplanner.com/ for in depth retirement planning as a place to start. 

If you evenutally come to the conclusion that Retirement Age, Spending, and Inflation are the only things that seem to matter, my planner might be quicker and easier.


11/25 - I asked copilot to generate a similar calculator based on all of my parameters and it did a better job in a few seconds.
I asked it to critique my tool and it liked how i wrote functions to made adding new fields easier. 
I'm so glad that I'm retired.
